the MySQL Enterprise Backup product performs physical backups. 
MySQL Enterprise Backup performs hot backup operations for MySQL databases. 
  The product is architected for efficient and reliable backups of tables created by the InnoDB storage engine. 
  For completeness, it can also back up tables from MyISAM and other storage engines.
Physical backup tools include the mysqlbackup of MySQL Enterprise Backup for InnoDB or any other tables, 
  or file system-level commands (such as cp, scp, tar, rsync) for MyISAM tables.

Logical backup methods have these characteristics:
  The backup is done by querying the MySQL server to obtain database structure and content information.
  Backup and restore granularity is available at the server level (all databases), 
    database level (all tables in a particular database), or table level. 
    This is true regardless of storage engine.
  The backup does not include log or configuration files, or 
    other database-related files that are not part of databases.
  Logical backups are performed with the MySQL server running. 
    The server is not taken offline.
  Logical backup tools include the mysqldump program and 
    the SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE statement. 
    These work for any storage engine, even MEMORY.
  To restore logical backups, SQL-format dump files can be processed using the mysql client. 
    To load delimited-text files, use the LOAD DATA statement or the mysqlimport client.
